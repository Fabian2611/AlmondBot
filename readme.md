# Almond Bot v1.0.4
## A bombparty bot made in python.

This is almond bot, a simple python bot that plays bombparty on [jklm.fun](https://jklm.fun). It is <b>NOT A CHEAT</b>, but opens another browser window and can play the game against you.

### How to use
1. Install python 3.8 or higher.
2. Install the requirements by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the bot py running `py almondbot.py`. You have to be in the same directory as this file, you <b>cannot</b> run it from another path
4. You will be prompted to enter a lobby. If you want the bot to join a lobby, enter the lobby code. If you want the bot to create a lobby, press Enter without typing anything
5. In case the website says "Disconnected", please manually press on retry. Otherwise restart the bot. This happens when you get rate-limited by jklm.fun.
6. If nobody joins for more than 5 minutes, the bot shuts off.
7. Hold F8 to stop the bot while producing a log. Hold F9 to stop the bot without a log.
